# Windows Console environment setup

## What this installs

 * Git (with unix tools) and my fork of the git credential store allowing multiple users
 * Vim (with vundle and a bunch of plugins)
 * Conemu console 
 * Nodejs
 * My powershell profile and posh-git
 * Autohotkey and capslock -> escape key
 * Sublime text 2
 * Dropbox and Password safe

## Setup

 * Copy run.cmd and install.ps1 locally (no need to clone locally as this script installs git and does the clone)
 * Open an cmd prompt as administrator and run run.cmd
 * Open credential manager and add the githubToken, githubPassword, bitbucketToken and dnsimpletoken
 * Edit the ~/localconfig.json file and set the values
